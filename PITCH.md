# InsureTech AI — Claims Risk Analyzer (2–3 minute pitch)

**Problem:** Claims teams are drowning in volume. Risky claims look ordinary until it's too late, and manual triage wastes time.

**Solution:** InsureTech AI surfaces the *few* claims that matter most. Our analyzer blends statistical outlier detection with category-aware baselines to generate a prioritized investigation list—*with reason codes you can trust*.

**Demo Narrative:**
1. Upload today's claims CSV (or connect Snowflake). The dashboard auto-detects schema.
2. KPIs show overall exposure and a proxy loss ratio. Filters let us focus by region/product.
3. The **Investigation Shortlist** flags outliers (e.g., 6× typical for “Injury/Health” in NY) and explains *why* they're flagged.
4. Tweak thresholds to match your team's tolerance, then **export a CSV** or push cases to Jira/ServiceNow.
5. Use the **ROI calculator** to quantify monthly savings given your volumes and baseline detection.

**Business Impact:**
- 30–50% less time spent on manual triage.
- 15–30% more suspicious claims caught compared to rules-only baselines.
- Faster cycle times → better customer experience and lower leakage.

**Why Us:**
- Fast time-to-value: runs locally today; production-grade in weeks.
- Transparent by design: auditable thresholds and reason codes.
- Built to integrate: APIs + connectors + SSO/RBAC day one in production.
