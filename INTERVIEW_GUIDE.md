## 🎓 Anticipated Questions & Answers

### **Q: "How do you handle false positives?"**
**A**: "Great question. That's why we make thresholds tunable. Watch - if I increase the Z-score from 2.5 to 3.0, we reduce flags from 1,250 to 850. Teams can dial in their tolerance. Plus, reason codes help investigators quickly validate or dismiss."

### **Q: "What if my data schema is different?"**
**A**: "We have automatic column mapping. The system recognizes 'Income,' 'Salary,' or 'Income_Level' as the same field. Works with insurance_dataset.csv and data_synthetic.csv out of the box. Easy to extend."

### **Q: "How does this integrate with our existing systems?"**
**A**: "Today: CSV export. Production: REST API, webhooks to Jira/ServiceNow, Snowflake connector, S3 batch processing. All designed for day-one integration."

### **Q: "Can we customize the risk model?"**
**A**: "Absolutely. The IsolationForest weight (default 60%) and Z-score weight (40%) are configurable. You can also add domain-specific rules, train on historical fraud cases, or incorporate external data."

### **Q: "What about PII and security?"**
**A**: "In this demo, we run locally - no data leaves your machine. Production adds: SSO (Okta/Azure AD), row-level encryption, audit logs for compliance, RBAC for access control. The lock toggle is a preview of that."

### **Q: "How long to production?"**
**A**: "Fast time-to-value is our specialty. Proof-of-concept: 2 weeks. Pilot with real data: 4-6 weeks. Production-grade with SSO, connectors, and monitoring: 8-12 weeks."

Most tools ignore bad data. We detect, highlight, and let you choose how to handle it.

### **3. Business-Focused**
Not just "here are anomalies" - we show ROI, preset scenarios, industry benchmarks.

### **4. Production-Ready Mindset**
RBAC demo, integration architecture, security mentions throughout.

### **5. Interactive & Responsive**
Every control has immediate visual feedback. No "submit and wait."
